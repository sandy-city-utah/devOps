# Sandy City DevOps Engineer Code Test


BRIEF: Your test is to build and deploy a short "Hello World" API code base. You will be provided with a secure VPN and server credentials to access and configure a VMWare Ubuntu server. Ensure that you utilize git version control during your code implementation. Following your deployment to the test server, please push your local code base to a GitHub repo. In your README file please answer the process questions listed at the bottom.

> NOTE: This test is designed to be fairly short. The options allow for it to be completed at a junior engineer level or scale up in difficulty if you wish to demonstrate a higher level. If there are areas you're unsure about, you can reach out with questions and/or do what you think is best. **Any amount of the test completion is viable** and will facilitate a great starting point during a follow up interview.

Looking forward and thank you!


### PART 1 WRITE A SIMPLE TEST API

On Part 1 choose Test A or Test B depending upon your skill level and time. Proceed to Part 2 deployment.

Test A- Hello World Basic API
- Using the server-side language and framework of your choice, (exp. Node js and Express), build a simple "Hello World" API endpoint that can be tested in postman.

Test B- Hello World Restful API
- Persist the "Hello World" string in a SQL database.
- Make a RESTful API with routes that enable CRUD operations.

Optional Bonus: With the testing framework of your choice write an automated unit test for the endpoint(s).  


### PART 2- CONFIGURE THE TEST SERVER AND DEPLOY
Configure the test server we provided as a production environment and deploy your API code base.

Optional Bonus: Implement any continuous deployment automation functionality.  

### Q/A FOR YOUR README
- [x] Describe your workflow. Are you code-first and command-line or GUI based in some areas?

- [x] What tech stack did you choose to build with and why?

- [x] Describe your design structure of the mini API code base. Did you base your choices off of any particular architecture pattern?

- [x] Describe your server configuration and deployment process choices?

- [x] How would you implement an automated deployment process instead of manual deployment i.e. describe any workflows, tools, libraries, and methodologies...

- [x] What did you identify as potential or real vulnerabilities during this process? What safeguards did/would you put in place to address these? How did you protect credentials, secrets, and/or non-public components.
